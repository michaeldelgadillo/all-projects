# <Hello World!>
I remember when I wrote my first line of code, I was instantly hooked. 🪝<br>
Fast forward to today and I still truly enjoy the art of creating software to solve big problems.<br>
I'm currently working on completing my Bachelor's in Computer Science from WGU.<br>
Check out the different projects I've created over the years and let me know if you have any questions.
